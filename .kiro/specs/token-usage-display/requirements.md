# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds token counting and usage display functionality to the chat interface. Users will be able to see how many tokens were used for each AI message by clicking on the existing info button, which will reveal a dropdown showing token usage statistics.

## Glossary

- **Chat System**: The application's chat interface that handles user and AI messages
- **Token**: A unit of text processing used by AI models (typically words, subwords, or characters)
- **Tokenizer**: A component that converts text into tokens and counts them
- **Info Button**: The existing button displayed under each AI message
- **Token Usage Dropdown**: A collapsible UI element that displays token statistics when the info button is clicked
- **AI Provider**: The backend service (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) that processes messages

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see token usage information for each AI message, so that I can understand the cost and resource consumption of my conversations

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI message is received, THE Chat System SHALL calculate and store the token count for that message
2. THE Chat System SHALL display token usage information including input tokens, output tokens, and total tokens
3. WHEN a user clicks the info button under an AI message, THE Token Usage Dropdown SHALL expand to show the token statistics
4. THE Token Usage Dropdown SHALL display the information in a clear, readable format with labeled values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a tokenizer implementation that works with different AI providers, so that token counting is accurate regardless of which model is being used

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Tokenizer SHALL support token counting for OpenAI models
2. THE Tokenizer SHALL support token counting for Anthropic models
3. THE Tokenizer SHALL support token counting for Ollama and local models using appropriate estimation methods
4. WHEN a message is processed, THE Tokenizer SHALL return accurate token counts based on the specific model being used
5. THE Tokenizer SHALL handle both text and multimodal content (text with images)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the token usage display to integrate seamlessly with the existing UI, so that it feels like a natural part of the interface

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Token Usage Dropdown SHALL use the existing info button without requiring additional UI elements
2. WHEN the dropdown is closed, THE Chat System SHALL show only the info button
3. WHEN the dropdown is open, THE Chat System SHALL display token statistics below the info button
4. THE Token Usage Dropdown SHALL match the existing design system and styling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want token counting to happen automatically, so that I don't need to manually trigger it

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI response is received, THE Chat System SHALL automatically calculate token usage
2. THE Chat System SHALL store token usage data with each message
3. THE Token Usage Dropdown SHALL display stored token data without requiring additional API calls
4. IF token counting fails, THEN THE Chat System SHALL handle the error gracefully and display a fallback message
